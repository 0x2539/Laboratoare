**DO NOT** post questions here.

2. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to
see if it was already reported or fixed. In case it wasn't, create your report
with a **clear description** of the issue and a **code sample** that
demonstrates it. Include the browsers where you've spoted the issue and the
versions of jQuery and Guillotine you used.

The more information you give, the easier it becomes to track the issue and fix
it. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself and others to replicate
the bug and figure out a fix.

Thanks for your time and support!
